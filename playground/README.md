# ESLint Plugin Harlanzw - Playground

This is a StackBlitz playground showcasing the ESLint rules from `eslint-plugin-harlanzw`.

## Features

This playground demonstrates 5 Vue-specific ESLint rules:

1. **vue-no-faux-composables** - Functions starting with "use" should actually be composables
2. **vue-no-nested-reactivity** - Avoid nested reactive objects that can cause performance issues
3. **vue-no-passing-refs-as-props** - Don't pass refs directly as props to components
4. **vue-no-ref-access-in-templates** - Access ref values correctly in templates
5. **vue-no-torefs-on-props** - Avoid using toRefs on the entire props object

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
